emacs-celery
============

A dumb emacs client to try and control celery pool from emacs.

# How

Partial wrapper around `celery` command to:
- extract current stats
- ...

We should be able to do more:
- pool grow, shrink, etc...

# Deps

celery or ssh configuration on a ready celery node

# Stability

As is.
Feel free to file bugs or propose PR to improve.
