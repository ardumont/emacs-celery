A minor mode to draw stats from celery and more?

* Mode install

For the moment, on marmalade.

* How

Partial wrapper around `celery` command to, at the moment:
- extract current stats
- ...

We should be able to do more, typically what the celery command is able to do:
- pool grow
- pool shrink
- etc...
* Deps

Celery application running on your box or ssh configuration on a ready celery node

** celery on boxes

Either install celery on the box:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install -y celeryd
#+end_src

** celery on remote box

Or have a remote box celery ready.
You'll have to customize the mode to execute the celery command remotely.

*** Example 1

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(celery-command "ssh -i ssh-access-key -p 5647 -l user celery-ready-remote-node celery"))
#+end_src

*** Example 2

Improved example 1 using ~/.ssh/config (standard use) to simplify:

#+begin_src txt
Host celery-ready-remote-node
Hostname your-celery-hostname
Port 5647
User user
IdentityFile ssh-access-key
#+end_src

so the customize command becomes:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(celery-command "ssh celery-ready-remote-node celery"))
#+end_src

* OS?

I'm a GNU/linux user so tested on this (debian).
Still, it's emacs so it should be ok on all boxes as long as the celery configuration is ok.

* Stability

It's a bootstrap and driven according to my actual needs.

Api breakage is a possibility.

Feel free to file bugs or propose PR to improve.
