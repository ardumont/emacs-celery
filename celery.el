;;; Commentary:

;; o.s. pre-requisite:
;; - either an accessible remote celery ready machine
;; - either your local celery ready machine

;; For example, either the local machine with:
;; - celery installed on machine (apt-get install -y celeryd)
;; - A ssh ready machine (cf. README.org for detailed example)
;;
;; If using ssh, configure this mode to know it:
;; (custom-set-variables '(celery-command "ssh remote-node celery"))
;; and you should be good to go.
;;
;; You can order or filter the celery data outputed per worker using
;; `celery-workers-list':
;; (custom-set-variables '(celery-workers-list '(aw01 aw02)))
